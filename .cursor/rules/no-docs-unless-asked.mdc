# No New Documentation Unless Asked

**Do not create new documentation files** (README, guides, implementation notes, summary docs, etc.) unless the user explicitly asks for documentation.

- **Comment code** as usual: add comments for non-obvious logic, "why" not "what."
- **Do not** add new `.md` files, docs folders, or written guides unless the user requests them.

When in doubt, implement and comment; do not document in separate files.
